I am currently an ML Researcher at [Cloudaeye](https://www.cloudaeye.com/), a startup based in Fremont, California, where I rejoined in July 2024.

Prior to my current role, I served as a Research Associate at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, Indian Institute of Science](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) from November 2023 to June 2024. During this time, I focused on applying deep generative modeling in Energy Informatics and led a project on using GANs for energy anomaly detection. My work resulted in a paper presented at the AI4TS workshop at the AAAI 24 conference.

Before that, I was a Research Associate at [FLAME University's](https://www.flame.edu.in/) Centre for Mathematical Modelling from January to November 2023. There, I led projects on Explainable AI and Genetic Algorithms, and also served as a Teaching Assistant for various courses.

My first role at [Cloudaeye](https://www.cloudaeye.com/) was as an ML Engineer from July 2021 to October 2022, where I developed and deployed advanced deep learning solutions for anomaly detection in cloud-native applications.

I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) (2019-2021) and a B.Sc. in Mathematics from D.G Ruparel College, Mumbai University (2016-2019).



### üôåüî¨ Collaborations & Projects

I've had the opportunity to collaborate on several impactful projects:

- Worked with [Dr. Pandarasamy Arjunan](https://www.samy101.com/) on applying machine learning to optimize building energy management.
- Explored explainable AI, genetic algorithms, and application of ML in Bioinfomratics with [Dr. Jayaraman Valadi](https://www.flame.edu.in/faculty/jayaraman-v-k).
- During my internship at [CMI](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), I collaborated with [Dr. Venkatesh Vinayakarao](http://vvtesh.co.in/) on implementing topic modeling to align functionality scripts with software documentation.


### üòä Reserch Interests

My research interests focus on deep learning and generative modeling, with an emphasis on its applications, such as anomaly detection, among others. I have authored several publications, including refereed conference papers, journal articles, and a book chapter, covering topics such as GANs, anomaly detection, explainable AI, and applications of machine learning in various domains.
