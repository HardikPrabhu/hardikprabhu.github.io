I am a research associate at FLAME University, specializing in generative modeling, deep learning, anomaly detection, and interpretable machine learning. My educational background includes an M.Sc. in Data Science from  [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).

With over 2 years of combined industry and research experience, I previously served as an ML Engineer at Cloudaeye, a startup based in Silicon Valley. During my time there, I applied machine learning techniques to provide solutions for detecting anomalies and performing root cause analyses in cloud-native applications. My research journey encompasses various publications on subjects such as interpretable AI, energy prediction, generative modeling, and anomaly detection. My interests revolve around generative modeling, explainable AI, data science, and applied machine learning.

Working closely with  [Dr. Jayaraman Valadi](https://www.flame.edu.in/faculty/jayaraman-v-k), I've engaged in projects centered around explainable AI, genetic algorithms, and generative modeling. Additionally, I've collaborated with [Dr. Pandersamy Arjunan](https://www.samy101.com/) on utilizing machine learning techniques for building energy management.

Within the FLAME University environment, my current projects delve into explainable AI, generative modeling, and genetic algorithms. I'm also involved as a teaching assistant for courses on computational modeling and machine learning. In addition to my research and teaching responsibilities, I actively mentor undergraduate students in their research projects, guiding them to explore and develop their ideas. I possess proficiency in Python and am skilled in working with libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.
