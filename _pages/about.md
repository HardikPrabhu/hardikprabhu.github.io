 I serve as a Research Associate at Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, Indian Institute of Science (IISC). My current project revolves around application of generative modelling in Energy Time series datasets. 
 
My educational background includes an M.Sc. in Data Science from  [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). 
I have over 3 years of combined industry and research experience, I previously served as an ML Engineer at Cloudaeye, a startup based in Silicon Valley. During my time there, I applied machine learning techniques to provide solutions for detecting anomalies and performing root cause analyses in cloud-native applications. My research journey encompasses various publications on subjects such as interpretable AI, energy prediction, generative modeling, and anomaly detection. 

Before my current role, I was a Research Associate at FLAME University's Centre for Mathematical Modelling, where I worked on projects related to explainable AI, generative modeling, and genetic algorithms. Additionally, I contributed as a Teaching Assistant, instructing courses in computational modeling, quantitative analysis, and machine learning. I also actively mentored undergraduates in their research, helping them develop and execute their project ideas.


### Collaborations and Projects
My work with [Dr. Pandersamy Arjunan](https://www.samy101.com/) has been instrumental in applying machine learning methodologies for optimizing building energy management. In collaboration with [Dr. Jayaraman Valadi](https://www.flame.edu.in/faculty/jayaraman-v-k), I have delved into  projects revolving around explainable AI, genetic algorithms, and generative modeling.  Additionally, my reserch internship at CMI under [Dr. Venkatesh Vinayakrao](http://vvtesh.co.in/) involved implementing  topic modeling to align functionality scripts with documentation for a distinguished software company.

### Reserch Interests

My research interests focus on deep learning and generative modeling, with an emphasis on its applications, such as anomaly detection, among others. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in areas like model interpretability and representation learning.
