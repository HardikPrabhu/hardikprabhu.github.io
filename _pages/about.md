# About Me

I am a research associate at FLAME University. My educational background includes an M.Sc. in Data Science from  [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).  My reserch interests revolve around generative modeling, model interpretabliltiy, data science, and applied machine learning.

With over 2 years of combined industry and research experience, I previously served as an ML Engineer at Cloudaeye, a startup based in Silicon Valley. During my time there, I applied machine learning techniques to provide solutions for detecting anomalies and performing root cause analyses in cloud-native applications. My research journey encompasses various publications on subjects such as interpretable AI, energy prediction, generative modeling, and anomaly detection.

Within the FLAME University environment, my current projects delve into explainable AI, generative modeling, and genetic algorithms. I'm also involved as a teaching assistant for courses on computational modeling and machine learning. In addition to my research and teaching responsibilities, I actively mentor undergraduate students in their research projects, guiding them to explore and develop their ideas. I possess proficiency in Python and am skilled in working with libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

### Collaborations and Projects

In collaboration with [Dr. Jayaraman Valadi](https://www.flame.edu.in/faculty/jayaraman-v-k), I have delved into  projects revolving around explainable AI, genetic algorithms, and generative modeling. My work with [Dr. Pandersamy Arjunan](https://www.samy101.com/) has been instrumental in applying machine learning methodologies for optimizing building energy management. Additionally, my reserch  internship at CMI under [Dr. Venkatesh Vinayakrao](http://vvtesh.co.in/) involved implementing  topic modeling to align functionality scripts with documentation for a distinguished software company.
