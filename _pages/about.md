Hardik Prabhu is a research associate at FLAME University with expertise in generative modeling, deep learning, anomaly detection, and interpretable machine learning. He holds an M.S. in Data Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute and a B.S. in Mathematics from D.G Ruparel College.

Hardik has over 2 years of industry and research experience. Previously he worked as an ML Engineer at Cloudaeye, a silicon valley startup, where he applied machine learning to deliver solutions for anomaly detection and root cause analysis in cloud-native applications. He has authored publications on topics such as interpretable AI, energy prediction, generative modelling and anomaly detection. His research interests span generative modeling, explainable AI, data science, and applied machine learning.

Under the guidance of [Dr. Jayaraman Valadi](https://www.flame.edu.in/faculty/jayaraman-v-k), Hardik has worked on projects involving explainable AI and genetic algorithms optimization of machine learning models. In collaboration with [Dr. Pandersamy Arjunan](https://www.samy101.com/), he has worked on application of machine learning in building energy management.



At FLAME University, Hardik engages in projects involving explainable AI, generative modelling and genetic algorithms. He also serves as a teaching assistant for computational modeling and machine learning courses. Hardik is proficient in Python and adept at working with libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.
