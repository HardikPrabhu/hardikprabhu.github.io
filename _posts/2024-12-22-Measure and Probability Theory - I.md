# What these series of blogs contains

These blogs focus on key concepts from two reference books that I found valuable. While I will generally omit proofs, I'll point out notable techniques and insights that are essential for understanding certain proofs. For a detailed understanding, I encourage reading the books themselves and working out the chapter exercises.

The books are available here:

# Rings, Algebras, Sigma Algebras

Before talking more concretely about measures, we should have a consistent notion of what we are allowed to measure. Not everything is going to be measurable. Intuitively, given a set of entities, such as a collection of objects, we would like to have some uniform way to compare the different collections and assign them meaningful numerical values that reflect their size or extent a.k.a measure. It could be as simple as counting the number of elements in the set. Or the length, area or volume a set of points covers in Euclidean space.

When dealing with collections of objects or sets in a space, we often want to perform operations on these sets and still be able to measure the results. Two fundamental operations we frequently encounter are unions and differences of sets.

For unions, we want our measure to be additive in some sense. If we have two non-overlapping sets A and B, we would expect the measure of their union $(A \cup B)$ to be the sum of their measures. For set differences, we want our measure to reflect the intuitive notion of "subtracting" one set from another. we would then expect the measure of their difference to be the measure of A minus the measure of B.

Therefore, the resulting sets obtained by performing these fundamental operations should be measurable. This leads us to define the fundamental collection of subsets of a space, called a ring.

**Definition 1.** A ring is a collection of subsets on which a measure could be defined.

* Closed under union: If $A$ and $B$ are in $\mathcal{R}$, then $A \cup B$ is also in $\mathcal{R}$
* Closed under set difference: If $A$ and $B$ are in $\mathcal{R}$, then $A \setminus B$ is also in $\mathcal{R}$
* The empty set $\emptyset$ is in $\mathcal{R}$

**Properties 1.** The following properties can be derived from the above definition:

* Closed under finite unions: By using the principle of mathematical induction, we can show that if $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ are in $\mathcal{R}$, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$ is also in $\mathcal{R}$
* Closed under finite intersections: For any $A, B \in \mathcal{R}$, we have $A \cap B = A \setminus (A \setminus B)$. Since $\mathcal{R}$ is closed under set difference, $A \cap B \in \mathcal{R}$. This can be extended to finite intersections by induction
* Closed under symmetric difference: For any $A, B \in \mathcal{R}$, the symmetric difference $A \triangle B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$ is in $\mathcal{R}$, as $\mathcal{R}$ is closed under both set difference and union

**Definition 2.** An algebra is a ring of subsets of $X$, which also contains the set $X$.

The most trivial example of an algebra is the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ of $X$.

**Definition 3.** A $\sigma$-ring $\mathcal{S}$ on a set $X$ is a ring of subsets of $X$ that is closed under countable unions as well.

If ${A_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a countable sequence of sets in $\mathcal{S}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{S}$.

Similarly, $\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable unions.

**Properties 2.** The following properties describe how a ring is generated from an arbitrary collection of subsets of $X$. Let $\varepsilon \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$. Then:

* The collection of subsets of $X$ which can be covered by the union of finite members of $\varepsilon$ is a ring:
  $\mathcal{R}_\varepsilon = \{A \subseteq X : A \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n E_i \text{ for some finite } n \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } E_1, ..., E_n \in \mathcal{E}\}$
* If we replace finite union with countable then $\mathcal{R}_\varepsilon$ is a $\sigma$-ring
* $\mathcal{R}_\varepsilon$ contains $\varepsilon$
* Let ${\mathcal{R}_\alpha}_{\alpha \in I}$ be a collection of rings on a set $X$. Then $\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \mathcal{R}_\alpha$ is also a ring on $X$
* Hence, the smallest ring containing $\varepsilon$ is the intersection of all the rings containing it
* Therefore, all the members of the smallest ring $\mathcal{R}(\varepsilon)$, also known as the ring generated by $\varepsilon$ can be covered by some finite union of members of $\varepsilon$
* Extending the same notion to $\sigma$-ring, $\mathcal{S}(\varepsilon)$ is the smallest sigma ring containing $\varepsilon$. And it is the intersection of all the $\sigma$-rings containing it. Moreover, all its elements can be covered by a countable union of members of $\varepsilon$

# Measures on rings

Rings form the mathematical foundation for what we can measure, with sigma algebras being particularly important. For example in probability theory, the measure is defined for the sigma-algebra containing subsets of a sample space.

**Definition 4.** A measure, $\mu$ on the ring $R$ is an extended real-valued function such that:

* $\mu(E) \geq 0$ for all $E \in R$
* $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
* $\mu$ is countably additive. If ${E_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of disjoint sets in $R$ such that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in R$, then:
  $\mu(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_n)$

**Properties 1.** Monotonicity: For any sets $A, B \in R$, if $A \subseteq B$, then:
$\mu(A) \leq \mu(B)$

**Properties 2.** Countable Subadditivity: For any sequence of sets ${E_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $R$ where $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in R$:
$\mu(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_n)$

# Probability as a Measure

Probability is defined as a measure on a sigma alebra of sample space. When we conduct a random experiment, we begin with the sample space $\Omega$ (omega), which contains all possible outcomes of the experiment. A sigma algebra $\mathcal{F}$ contains events which are subsets of the sample space. A event is said to occur when the observation (outcome) of the random experiment belongs to the event. 

A collection of such events forms a $\sigma$-algebra (sigma-algebra) $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\Omega$, which satisfies three key properties:

1. The sample space $\Omega$ itself belongs to $\mathcal{F}$
2. If an event $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}$, then its complement $A^c$ also belongs to $\mathcal{F}$
3. The union of any countable sequence of events in $\mathcal{F}$ also belongs to $\mathcal{F}$

Probability $P$ is defined as a measure that satisfies the following axioms:

1. Non-negativity: For any event $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $P(A) \geq 0$
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$
3. Countable additivity: For any sequence of disjoint events ${A_n}$ in $\mathcal{F}$, $P(\bigcup A_n) = \sum P(A_n)$

This measure-theoretic approach provides the mathematical framework necessary for handling both discrete and continuous probability distributions within a unified theory. It allows us to rigorously define concepts like random variables, independence, and conditional probability.

In the next blog I will discuss about measurable functions and random variables.
