excerpt: 'Gas holdup in an internal loop air-lift contactor is one of the primary hydrodynamic features that governs the performance of the contactor. Prediction of gas holdup assumes importance in design of air-lift contactor. The current work focusses on the use of data driven models for prediction of gas holdup, as the existing empirical correlations were found to be inadequate. Towards the work, 324 data points from the reported works on internal draft air-lift contactor are collected. Random forest regression, a powerful black-box model is employed in order to accurately predict gas hold-up in presence of other features.  The model's hyperparameters are optimized using a genetic algorithm, thereby enhancing its performance. To enhance interpretability and gain a deeper understanding of the model's predictions, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is employed to explain the outputs of the black-box model. The model's performance is assessed using two evaluation metrics, namely MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and R2 score. Through the process of hyperparameter tuning, a notable enhancement in the model's performance is observed. Prior to tuning the hyperparameters, the R2 value was measured at 0.9268, while after tuning, it significantly improved to 0.9542.'
