excerpt: 'There has been an increasing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) in recent years. Complex machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural
networks, can accurately predict outcomes, but provide little insight into how the
decision was made or what factors influenced the outcome. This lack of transparency
can be a major issue in high-stakes decision-making scenarios, where understanding
the reasoning behind a decision is crucial. XAI aims to address the problem of the
”black box” in machine learning models, where the AI’s decision-making process
is not transparent, and humans cannot understand how the AI arrived at a particular
decision or prediction. Evolutionary and metaheuristic techniques offer promising
avenues for achieving explainability in AI systems, and there is a lot of ongoing research
in this area to further explore their potential. Our work is a concise literature
review that explores the potential adoption of these techniques to facilitate the attainment
of explainability in AI systems.We have highlighted some of the contributions
of evolutionary and metaheuristic techniques in different approaches to achieving
explainability, such as counterfactual explanations, local surrogate modelling, and
the development of transparent models.'
