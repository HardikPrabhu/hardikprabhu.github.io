excerpt: 'AMPylation is a biologically significant yet understudied post-translational modification where an adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) group is added Tyrosine and Threonine residues primarily. While recent work has illuminated the prevalence and
functional impacts of AMPylation, experimental identification of AMPylation sites remains challenging. Computational prediction
techniques provide a faster alternative approach. The predictive performance of machine learning models is highly dependent
on the features used to represent the raw amino acid sequences. In this work, we introduce a novel feature extraction pipeline to
encode the key properties relevant to AMPylation site prediction. We utilize a recently published dataset of curated AMPylation
sites to develop our feature generation framework. We demonstrate the utility of our extracted features by training various machine learning classifiers, on various numerical representations of the raw sequences extracted with the help of our framework. 10-fold
cross-validation is used to evaluate the modelâ€™s capability to distinguish between AMPylated and non-AMPylated sites. The
top-performing set of features extracted achieved MCC score of 0.58, Accuracy of 0.8, AUC-ROC of 0.85 and F1 score of 0.73.
Further, we elucidate the behaviour of the model on the set of features consisting of monogram and bigram counts for various
representations using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations.'
