excerpt: 'Buildings consume significant energy, accounting for approximately
40% of total energy usage worldwide. Unfortunately, on average,
commercial buildings waste around 30% of the energy they consume. In recent years, the advancement of artificial intelligence
and smart metering infrastructure has led to the emergence of datadriven methods for energy prediction and anomaly detection. These
methods provide automated decision support to building operators
in managing and preventing energy loss. Despite the advantages
of having sophisticated data-driven models, one major drawback
is their lack of transparency. This paper focuses on enhancing the
transparency of data-driven models for energy prediction and anomaly detection. The research investigates the utilization of SHapely
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an explainable AI algorithm, to provide insights into large-scale energy prediction and anomaly detection models. Additionally, the present study introduces a framework
that seamlessly integrates feature transformations within the model,
while SHAP operates on the interpreatable feature space, enhancing
the explanations provided by SHAP values.'
