Detection in Smart Building Energy Time Series Data"

excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose the use of a 1D deep convolutional generative
adversarial network (DCGAN) for anomaly detection in building
energy time series data. The model is trained usingWasserstein
loss on normal energy usage data to learn standard consumption
patterns. To detect anomalies, we use gradient descent to reconstruct
a given energy sub-sequence by finding the noise vector
that most closely generates the sub-sequence through the generator
network. The reconstruction error between the original and
reconstructed sub-sequence, based on dynamic time warping and
the prior probability distribution on the latent space, serves as an
anomaly score. By conducting experiments on real-world building
energy datasets, we aim to demonstrate the potential of this
approach for identifying anomalous energy consumption.'
