Reconstruction for Energy Time Series Anomaly Detection"

excerpt: 'In this paper, we employ a 1D deep convolutional generative
adversarial network (DCGAN) for sequential anomaly detection
in energy time series data. Anomaly detection involves
gradient descent to reconstruct energy sub-sequences, identifying
the noise vector that closely generates them through
the generator network. Soft-DTW is used as a differentiable
alternative for the reconstruction loss and is found to be superior
to Euclidean distance. Combining reconstruction loss
and the latent spaceâ€™s prior probability distribution serves as
the anomaly score. Our novel method accelerates detection by
parallel computation of reconstruction of multiple points and
shows promise in identifying anomalous energy consumption
in buildings, as evidenced by performing experiments on
hourly energy time series from 15 buildings.'
